### What I learned

Althought the challenge may seem easy at first sight, I had to revisit my table concepts again to refresh my memory. I think it has been a while since I did a project that included a table. Other than that, I had  a blast while doing this challenge.

### Continued development

Overall, I think this project has shown me that any topic can come up in a project, hence not stressing in trying to get all the concepts on a topic at once, since I can always revisit and learn much faster than the last time.

### Useful resources

- [HTML table basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics) - this helped at first to have a memory refresh on the concept of HTML tables elements and structure.

- [Table styling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Styling_tables) - This is an amazing resource if you want to know how to customize your table while following all the conventional rule on table styling.
